# sketch-paginate
Pagination plugin for sketch app.

This is a work in progress plugin to add pagination to Artboards. Right now youâ€™ll have to create a text layer with the layer name `{pagination}` in each Artboard. And each dartboard will have to be sorted by Sketch's default ordering (first Artboard in the layer list is actually the last Artboard).

Disclaimer: It was highly inspired by bomberstudios's [Sketch Commands > Numberize](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-commands/tree/master/Sketch%20Commands.sketchplugin/Contents/Sketch/Numberize)
