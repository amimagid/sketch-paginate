# sketch-paginate
Pagination plugin for sketch app.

This is a work in progress plugin to add pagination to artboards. Right now youâ€™ll have to create a text layer with the layer name `{pagination}` in each Artboard. And each dartboard will have to be sorted by Sketch's default ordering (first artboard in the layer list is actually the last artboard)

---

TO-DO
- fire a dialog window to define pagination appearance (ex: `page 1/2` or just `1/2 ` or even `page 1 of 2` etc)
- make it work with new symbols
- automatically create text layer with pagination
- define position of that auto-created layer
